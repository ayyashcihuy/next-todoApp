# next-todoApp
just want to learn next with create some todo app

Hi, so this project i create to make me understand more about next js and also this project will updated everyday. if you see this project doesnt have pull request at that day, please kindly remind me at social media or just randomly punch me in the face. lol jk. i hope i can update this readme soon with cool feature.

Okay so heres my first update: i already create basic ui for the todos with server side function to access database using prisma for get todo. and also i create ui for detect if the data from db was empty.

### change:

1. read and create basic error boundaries. as i know error boundary is perfectly used to unexpected error that make your apps actually cannot being accessed.
2. create a little basic form for add todo.

### next:

1. install redux and state management in apps. will be good if i can implement it to control form modal
